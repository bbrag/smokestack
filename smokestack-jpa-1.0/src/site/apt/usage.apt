JPA Module Usage
------
  We provide with a MockPersistenceProviderImpl that you gives you access to framework. 
  You can then use MockEntityManager and other mocks and finally validate using assertMockComplete() or 
  assertMockCommit().

  You can refer to the samples provided along with the source for more details.
